# Typography Poster Design – "Make Art, Make Love, Make Money"

## 🎯 Project Title:
Typography Practice – Task 3: Exploring Font Pairing, Hierarchy, Spacing & Visual Impact

## 📝 Description:
This poster was created as part of Task 3 under the Typography Practice module. The goal was to explore the art of typography through font pairing, alignment, spacing, and creating a strong visual and emotional impact using only text elements. The quote used — “Make Art, Make Love, Make Money” — reflects a balance between creativity, passion, and ambition.

## 🧠 Objectives Achieved:
- Effective use of **font pairing** (elegant serif and script styles)
- Applied **typographic hierarchy** through varied font sizing
- Controlled **line spacing and alignment** for balanced layout
- Created emotional tone using **type psychology**
- Incorporated a subtle **textured background** to elevate design aesthetics

## 📐 Tools Used:
- **Canva** (Typography Tools, Text Effects, Backgrounds, Frame Elements)
- Fonts: `Playfair Display`, `Italiana`, and similar serif-script pairings

## 🎨 Design Summary:
The poster employs a minimalist aesthetic with a soft paper texture background. The phrase is styled with a mix of calligraphic and serif fonts to reflect elegance and clarity. Each line is carefully spaced to enhance readability and visual flow. The layout adheres to a central vertical alignment with intentional size variation to create rhythm and emphasis.
